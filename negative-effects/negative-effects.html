        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Each year, an astounding amount of 8 million tons of plastic finds its
          way into the ocean, which is comparable to a truckload of plastic
          being dumped into the sea every single minute. Subsequently, this
          plastic embarks on a lengthy and devastating journey. Winnie Lau, a
          senior officer for The Pew Charitable Trusts' Preventing Ocean
          Plastics campaign, explains that the plastic entering the ocean can be
          transported over vast distances by ocean currents, reaching even
          remote areas like Antarctica and the Mariana Trench, the deepest
          location on Earth. As it travels, it infiltrates various ecosystems
          and inflicts immeasurable harm upon marine life.

        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine life,
          manifesting in various detrimental ways. One of the primary concerns
          is the mistaken consumption of plastic debris by marine animals,
          resulting in serious ingestion and digestive complications. The
          alarming consequences of this misidentification include nutrient
          deficiencies, internal injuries, and potential mortality.
          Additionally, entanglement in plastic waste presents a grave danger to
          marine creatures, as they can become trapped and suffer severe
          injuries or suffocation. Tragically, many marine species, such as sea
          turtles, dolphins, and seabirds, fall victim to these entanglements.
          Beyond the immediate impact on individual animals, the presence of
          plastics in the ocean disrupts ecosystems at large. The delicate
          balance and health of marine organisms are jeopardized as plastics
          infiltrate food chains and habitats, leading to long-term ecological
          consequences. The urgency to address plastic pollution is paramount to
          safeguarding the precious biodiversity and ecological integrity of our
          oceans.

        <h2>Human Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic pollution not only affects marine life but also has
          consequences for humans. When plastics break down into microplastics,
          they can enter the food chain and end up on our plates. Consumption of
          seafood contaminated with microplastics may pose health risks,
          including the potential transfer of toxic chemicals. Additionally,
          plastic pollution negatively impacts tourism, coastal economies, and
          overall environmental aesthetics.

        <h2>Where does waste come from?</h2>
        <p>
          Every year, the global production of plastic waste exceeds 300 million
          tons, and this figure continues to climb. However, the recycling rate
          of all the plastic waste ever generated is a mere 9%, while the
          majority is either burned or disposed of, primarily ending up in
          landfills. A significant contributing factor to this issue is that
          half of the plastic we manufacture is designed for single-use
          purposes. Items such as straws, plastic bags, and water bottles are
          intended to be discarded immediately after fulfilling their intended
          function. Due to the sheer volume and rapid disposal of single-use
          plastic, there is a substantial increase in the amount of waste that
          finds its way into landfills. Consequently, this amplifies the
          quantity of plastic that inevitably escapes into the environment.
